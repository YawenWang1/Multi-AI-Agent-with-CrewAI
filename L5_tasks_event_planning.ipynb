      "Welcome to the Conservatory at One Sansome, a breathtaking new event space in the heart of downtown San Francisco - 113 years in the making.Crowned by a soaring glass atrium that floods the fully unobstructed 8,100 square feet of primary space with natural light, The Conservatory offers a one-of-a-kind guest experience for the most exclusive weddings, corporate events, nonprofit galas and fundraisers. The entire space consists of the Atrium, the Holbrook House bar and restaurant, and the sophisticated North Lobby, amounting to nearly 16,000 square feet of usable, rentable event space accommodating up to 2,046 guests.Book a Tour\n",
      "History Reimagined\n",
      "Standing for generations as the nerve center of the San Francisco Financial District, The Conservatory's graceful architecture - punctuated by granite-clad 38-foot Doric columns - and unique indoor/outdoor nature makes the venue one of the City's most coveted gathering spaces. Boasting a standing capacity of more than 2,000 guests, on site-access to BART and Muni, and its position just four blocks from Moscone Center, no other San Francisco event facility is so uniquely prepared to host the most complex and important events. The cherry on top? The Conservatory is also the home to the sumptuous and buzzy Holbrook House bar and restaurant, a triumph of design that burst onto the scene in 2023 to universal acclaim.Thoughtfully reimagined and fully restored in 2023, The Conservatory is a triumph of design, vision, and creative energy. Events are executed with unparalleled professionalism and total discretion, helmed by San Francisco hospitality veterans with deep experience leading marquee properties such as the Julia Morgan Ballroom and the Olympic Club. We welcome you to write your own chapter in the City's rich history with us.\n",

      "As AI becomes more embedded in real-world products and services, the center of gravity needs to shift from the cloud to the edge. From smartphones and laptops to vehicles and drones, edge devices are increasingly where AI needs to run—driven by demands for privacy, speed, reliability, and cost-efficiency.But deploying AI on the edge isn’t just a technical challenge—it’s a paradigm shift. Shipping a model is only the beginning. Maintaining, updating, and optimizing AI systems across distributed hardware environments requires new thinking, new architectures, and new strategies.This panel brings together leaders on the frontlines of edge AI to explore the why, how, and what’s next. They’ll discuss the biggest pain points enterprises face today, the tradeoffs between task-specific and general-purpose small language models, and what it will take to move from experimentation to scalable, ROI-positive deployment. \n",

      "As AI becomes more embedded in real-world products and services, the center of gravity needs to shift from the cloud to the edge. From smartphones and laptops to vehicles and drones, edge devices are increasingly where AI needs to run—driven by demands for privacy, speed, reliability, and cost-efficiency.But deploying AI on the edge isn’t just a technical challenge—it’s a paradigm shift. Shipping a model is only the beginning. Maintaining, updating, and optimizing AI systems across distributed hardware environments requires new thinking, new architectures, and new strategies.This panel brings together leaders on the frontlines of edge AI to explore the why, how, and what’s next. They’ll discuss the biggest pain points enterprises face today, the tradeoffs between task-specific and general-purpose small language models, and what it will take to move from experimentation to scalable, ROI-positive deployment. \n",

From smartphones and laptops to vehicles and drones, edge devices are increasingly where AI needs to run—driven by demands for privacy, speed, reliability, and cost-efficiency.But deploying AI on the edge isn’t just a technical challenge—it’s a paradigm shift. Shipping a model is only the beginning. Maintaining, updating, and optimizing AI systems across distributed hardware environments requires new thinking, new architectures, and new strategies.This panel brings together leaders on the frontlines of edge AI to explore the why, how, and what’s next. They’ll discuss the biggest pain points enterprises face today, the tradeoffs between task-specific and general-purpose small language models, and what it will take to move from experimentation to scalable, ROI-positive deployment. \n",
