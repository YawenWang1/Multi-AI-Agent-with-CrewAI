That means some of the issues that have been weighing on economic growth and homeownership won't get much relief from easier Fed monetary policy. Meanwhile, international inflation patterns have begun to diverge, but prices are still rising in countries including the U.K. and Canada.The U.S. housing market has yet to regain its equilibrium following the COVID-19 pandemic. After going through a mini boom during the pandemic—when migration patterns shifted immensely in both size and speed—mortgage rates spiked, affordability weakened, and home sales tumbled.Arguably, still-high home prices are the main driver putting downward pressure on the U.S. homeownership rate, which has fallen to a multi-year low and essentially unwound its entire gain since the beginning of the pandemic. Our sense is that—particularly among younger and/or new homebuyers—this metric won't begin to maintain a durable uptrend until mortgage rates come down and home price growth moderates further in the existing home market. That must happen in the context of a labor market that continues to be resilient.The National Association of Realtors' Housing Affordability Index measures whether a typical family has sufficient income to qualify for a mortgage on a median-priced home. It assumes a 20% down payment and mortgage payments limited to 25% of income.The second housing affordability component is mortgage rates. As shown below, from a peak of nearly 8% in late 2023, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is now about 6.6%. Given the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will start cutting the federal funds rate this month, there is an assumption that mortgage rates would come down, as well.However, that's not necessarily the case. Bond market investors, not the Fed, \"control\" mortgage rates, which are typically most closely correlated with the 10-year Treasury bond yield. While the Fed can cut the federal funds rate—a very short-term rate that represents the interest banks charge each other for overnight loans—longer-term interest rates are more affected by investors' expectations about future inflation and economic growth. During the period last fall when the Fed lowered the federal funds rate by 100 basis points, mortgage rates rose by about 80 basis points (a basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point, so 80 basis points is equal to 0.8%). If a Fed short-term rate cut caused investors to expect higher inflation in the future, mortgage rates would not decline.With inflation elevated and fiscal deficits rising, there may not be room for Treasury yields to fall much further, especially those with longer-term maturities. We anticipate a modest move down in short-to-intermediate term Treasury yields over the next few months as the Federal Reserve lowers the federal funds rate, but long-term yields are likely to remain elevated in the absence of falling inflation and/or a decline in fiscal deficits.Recent inflation readings underscore the difficulty facing the bond market. Inflation has been above the Fed's 2% target for four years. It has fallen steeply from its pandemic peak but has been stuck in the 2.5% to 3.0% range for over a year. Recently, it has been edging higher and the flowthrough of tariffs will likely push it higher into 2026.Chart shows year-over-year change in PCE and core PCE growth. PCE: Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE DEFY Index), Core PCE: Personal Consumption Expenditures: All Items Less Food & Energy (PCE CYOY Index), percent change, year over year.The Fed's dual mandate requires it to set policy to achieve low inflation and full employment. With inflation elevated and the unemployment rate at 4.3%, it seems that a rate cut is not warranted. However, recent labor market data suggest there has been a slowdown in hiring with layoffs starting to pick up. The unemployment rate has held at a low level because there have been fewer new entrants into the labor force.We expect the Fed to cut rates at least twice by the end of the year. Beyond that, it would take a much weaker economy, a significant deterioration in the labor market, and/or much lower inflation to warrant further easing by the Fed.Government fiscal policy is also a factor that could keep long-term bond yields from falling much. Rising federal budget deficits imply the need for higher debt issuance that will need to be absorbed by the market. In the U.S., the market has remained fairly calm about the prospect for ever-rising deficits, but the steepening of the yield curve is an indication of growing market concerns. The difference in yields between five- and 30-year Treasuries, at roughly 120 basis points, is the widest since 2021. Our interpretation is that investors are demanding a higher yield for long-term Treasuries to compensate for the risk of inflation and/or depreciation of the dollar as a consequence of high debt levels.This spread is a calculated Bloomberg yield spread that replicates selling the current five-year U.S. Treasury Note and buying the current 30-year U.S. Treasury Note, then factoring the differences by 100. A basis point (bp or bps) is equal to 1/100th of 1%, or 0.01%. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.Inflation globally went up in sync across developed economies during the post-COVID period. While central banks initially viewed this inflation as \"transitory,\" or temporary, the increase in prices had the knock-on effect of raising wages. Wages, an input to most goods and services, contribute to rising prices across the economy when they increase, creating a feedback loop often referred to as a wage-price spiral.Developed economies' central banks started raising interest rates in 2022 to arrest inflation. Although the consumer price indexes (CPI) excluding food and energy prices (known as \"core\" CPI) peaked at different times, the rise and subsequent fall of inflation looked somewhat similar during this period. However, this year, we saw a divergence in the pattern. Inflation in the U.K. has increased due to an increase in minimum wages and energy bills, while the CPI in Canada is rising on the back of higher shelter costs and retaliatory tariffs in response to U.S. tariff threats. In the U.S., inflation has been sticky and the full impact of tariffs on goods prices may still be on the way. Meanwhile, the eurozone is notably seeing inflation continuing to trend lower.Looking at core inflation in isolation doesn't seem to tell the full story. Central banks in Canada and the eurozone have reversed nearly half of the most recent cycle's rate hikes. In the U.K., persistently high inflation has restrained the Bank of England’s ability to cut rates. Uncertainty over the impact of tariffs in the U.S. has kept the Federal Reserve on hold this year.Going forward, markets are expecting further rate cuts by all major central banks except the Bank of Japan.The potential for U.S. economic growth to slow has prompted markets to forecast an acceleration in rate cuts.Canada's economy contracted by 1.6% in the second quarter. Combined with temporary factors boosting inflation, the Bank of Canada may continue to cut rates.Markets may be expecting the Bank of England to continue to cut rates, but wages grew 5% in the second quarter due in part to tight labor market, which could constrain further tightening.The European Central Bank (ECB) may be at or near the end of rate cuts, having made progress both on inflation and reducing the policy rate. Economic weakness or downside risks to inflation could prompt another rate cut but an acceleration in the economy or inflation could keep the ECB on hold.The Bank of Japan stands alone in hiking rates, emerging from 30 years of deflation with its first rate hike of 17 years in March 2024. Further hikes will likely depend on wage growth keeping up with inflation, with eyes on annual union demands in November and December.The diverging trends and country-specific factors mean investors cannot generalize the direction in either inflation or monetary policy. In isolation, more rate cuts for the U.S. relative to the rest of the world could keep downward pressure on the U.S. dollar, which could boost returns for international stocks.Read TranscriptThe Federal Reserve is likely to cut short-term interest rates at least twice before the end of the year, but stubborn inflation may keep long-term bond yields and mortgage rates from declining much. That means some of the issues that have been weighing on economic growth and homeownership won't get much relief from easier Fed monetary policy. Meanwhile, international inflation patterns have begun to diverge, but prices are still rising in countries including the U.K. and Canada.U.S. stocks and economy: Mortgage rates pressure housing affordabilityThe U.S. housing market has yet to regain its equilibrium following the COVID-19 pandemic. After going through a mini boom during the pandemic—when migration patterns shifted immensely in both size and speed—mortgage rates spiked, affordability weakened, and home sales tumbled.Arguably, still-high home prices are the main driver putting downward pressure on the U.S. homeownership rate, which has fallen to a multi-year low and essentially unwound its entire gain since the beginning of the pandemic. Our sense is that—particularly among younger and/or new homebuyers—this metric won't begin to maintain a durable uptrend until mortgage rates come down and home price growth moderates further in the existing home market. That must happen in the context of a labor market that continues to be resilient.Homeownership rate has declined to a multi-year low \n",
      "Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, as of 6/30/2025.\n",
      "The National Association of Realtors' Housing Affordability Index measures whether a typical family has sufficient income to qualify for a mortgage on a median-priced home. It assumes a 20% down payment and mortgage payments limited to 25% of income.Housing affordability remains low\n",
      "Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, National Association of Realtors, as of 6/30/2025. \n",
      "The second housing affordability component is mortgage rates. As shown below, from a peak of nearly 8% in late 2023, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is now about 6.6%. Given the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will start cutting the federal funds rate this month, there is an assumption that mortgage rates would come down, as well.However, that's not necessarily the case. Bond market investors, not the Fed, \"control\" mortgage rates, which are typically most closely correlated with the 10-year Treasury bond yield. While the Fed can cut the federal funds rate—a very short-term rate that represents the interest banks charge each other for overnight loans—longer-term interest rates are more affected by investors' expectations about future inflation and economic growth. During the period last fall when the Fed lowered the federal funds rate by 100 basis points, mortgage rates rose by about 80 basis points (a basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point, so 80 basis points is equal to 0.8%). If a Fed short-term rate cut caused investors to expect higher inflation in the future, mortgage rates would not decline.Mortgage rates remain relatively high\n",
      "Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, as of 8/29/2025.\n",
      "Fixed income: The winding road to lower long-term ratesWith inflation elevated and fiscal deficits rising, there may not be room for Treasury yields to fall much further, especially those with longer-term maturities. We anticipate a modest move down in short-to-intermediate term Treasury yields over the next few months as the Federal Reserve lowers the federal funds rate, but long-term yields are likely to remain elevated in the absence of falling inflation and/or a decline in fiscal deficits.Recent inflation readings underscore the difficulty facing the bond market. Inflation has been above the Fed's 2% target for four years. It has fallen steeply from its pandemic peak but has been stuck in the 2.5% to 3.0% range for over a year. Recently, it has been edging higher and the flowthrough of tariffs will likely push it higher into 2026.Inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target\n",

PCE: Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE DEFY Index), Core PCE: Personal Consumption Expenditures: All Items Less Food & Energy (PCE CYOY Index), percent change, year over year.The Fed's dual mandate requires it to set policy to achieve low inflation and full employment. With inflation elevated and the unemployment rate at 4.3%, it seems that a rate cut is not warranted. However, recent labor market data suggest there has been a slowdown in hiring with layoffs starting to pick up. The unemployment rate has held at a low level because there have been fewer new entrants into the labor force.We expect the Fed to cut rates at least twice by the end of the year. Beyond that, it would take a much weaker economy, a significant deterioration in the labor market, and/or much lower inflation to warrant further easing by the Fed.Government fiscal policy is also a factor that could keep long-term bond yields from falling much.

      "Inflation has been a major concern for the US economy in 2024, with the annual inflation rate expected to have accelerated to 2.9% in August 2025, the highest since January. The US housing market has yet to regain its equilibrium following the COVID-19 pandemic, with the homeownership rate falling to a multi-year low. The Federal Reserve is likely to cut short-term interest rates at least twice before the end of the year, but stubborn inflation may keep long-term bond yields and mortgage rates from declining much.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is now about 6.6%, and while the Fed can cut the federal funds rate, longer-term interest rates are more affected by investors' expectations about future inflation and economic growth. The Fed's dual mandate requires it to set policy to achieve low inflation and full employment, but with inflation elevated and the unemployment rate at 4.3%, it seems that a rate cut is not warranted.\n",
      "\n",
      "The potential for US economic growth to slow has prompted markets to forecast an acceleration in rate cuts. Inflation globally went up in sync across developed economies during the post-COVID period, but this year, we saw a divergence in the pattern. Inflation in the UK has increased due to an increase in minimum wages and energy bills, while the CPI in Canada is rising on the back of higher shelter costs and retaliatory tariffs in response to US tariff threats.\n",
      "\n",
      "Central banks in Canada and the eurozone have reversed nearly half of the most recent cycle's rate hikes. In the UK, persistently high inflation has restrained the Bank of England's ability to cut rates. Uncertainty over the impact of tariffs in the US has kept the Federal Reserve on hold this year. The European Central Bank (ECB) may be at or near the end of rate cuts, having made progress both on inflation and reducing the policy rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bank of Japan stands alone in hiking rates, emerging from 30 years of deflation with its first rate hike of 17 years in March 2024. Further hikes will likely depend on wage growth keeping up with inflation, with eyes on annual union demands in November and December. The diverging trends and country-specific factors mean investors cannot generalize the direction in either inflation or monetary policy.\n",

      "Investors should be aware of the potential risks and opportunities in the current market, including the impact of inflation on interest rates, the housing market, and the overall economy. A detailed summary report highlighting the most impactful financial news and updates related to Inflation in the US and the impact on the stock market in 2024 should include key insights and their potential implications for the market and content strategy.\n",

      "outlook. In this scenario, continued geopolitical conflicts and trade actions cause inflation to stay higher for longer, driving the Federal Reserve to hike rates.1 Scenarios Baseline (70%): Real GDP growth slowed overall in the first quarter of 2024, coming in very close to our previous forecast’s expectations.2 We expect GDP growth will continue to moderate through the second half of this year and the start of the next, but the story is still positive overall. Consumer spending is forecasted to rise 2.3% this year, up from the 2.2% increase in 2023. Business investment is expected to increase 3% in 2024, down from 4.5% last year. Government spending is forecasted to rise 2.5%. Given that the US economy is expected to outperform many other global economies in the short term, we forecast imports to increase 3.1% on average in 2024, while exports are predicted to rise at a slower pace of 2.4%. Consumer price index (CPI) inflation stays above the 3% threshold for the second quarter of this year before falling to 2.7% by the end of 2024. The Federal Reserve succeeds in walking the tightrope to a soft landing by cutting rates twice in the second half of 2024 and continues with cuts until reaching the neutral rate of 2.5% to 3% by 2027. Job growth slows because current levels of job formation are not sustainable, given demographics and labor force participation. As a result, the unemployment rate falls in the short term, but rises to just under 4% in 2025 before gradually declining through the rest of the forecast period. Major investments prompted by the Inflation Reduction Act provide a boost to manufacturing.3 In addition, investments in intellectual property—such as the use of AI and other novel technologies—will continue to drive growth in the business sector. Overall, we expect the US economy to post real GDP growth of 2.4% this year, but for growth to slow to 1.1% in 2025. Between 2026 and 2028, economic growth is expected to pick back up, with annual gains in\n",

      "real GDP forecasted to range between 1.6% and 1.9% per year. Persistent inflation and geopolitical conflicts (20%): While our baseline remains positive, there are always downside risks to any forecast. We see risks centering around three interrelated issues: 1) geopolitical conflicts, 2) persistent inflation, and 3) financial system stress. Major conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East have been simmering for some time; either or both could flare up to a higher level. We see the most likely impact of such escalation coming in the form of higher prices of imported goods and oil. In this scenario, the price of oil spikes to around US$100 for three quarters before gradually declining. Geopolitical conflicts are not just fought with guns. The past two American administrations have used tariffs and sanctions to varying degrees as tools to influence adversaries. The use of these tools can have an impact on the prices faced by American firms and consumers. In this scenario, we model tariffs that increase the cost of imported intermediate inputs by 1% and imported final goods by a further 1%. As a result of the tariffs and the oil price shock, the Federal Reserve is driven to hike rates twice in the near term. Even with this action, CPI inflation persists above 3% until the second quarter of 2025. The latest Federal Reserve Financial Stability Report4 highlights three near-term risks to the stability of the financial system: higher-for-longer interest rates; worsening geopolitical conflict and spillovers; and strains on real-estate markets, particularly for office real estate. In line with the other assumptions outlined above, we therefore model an increase in stress in the financial system. In this scenario, GDP growth is lower than in the baseline scenario, particularly over the next two years. Growth in 2024 is 2.2%; by the following year, the tariffs are fully implemented, and growth in 2025 is just 0.6%. Growth averages 1.7% per year from 2026 to 2028. A golden era\n",

      "\n",
      "## Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "Inflation is a crucial economic factor that affects not only the purchasing power of consumers but also the performance of the stock market. As we move into 2024, analysts are closely monitoring inflation trends to gauge their potential impact on investment strategies. This post will explore the current state of inflation in the US, its projected trajectory, and the implications for the stock market.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Current State of Inflation\n",
      "\n",
      "As of late 2023, the US economy has seen fluctuating inflation rates due to a combination of supply chain disruptions, labor market dynamics, and governmental fiscal policies. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) has shown a gradual increase, leading to concerns about the cost of living for households. According to the latest data, inflation rates are projected to stabilize in 2024, settling around the Federal Reserve's target of 2% annually.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Key Drivers of Inflation**: \n",
      "    - Supply chain issues stemming from global events.\n",
      "    - Increased consumer demand as the economy rebounds.\n",
      "    - Wage growth in key sectors leading to higher costs for businesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Analysts suggest that to navigate the next year effectively, investors should keep a keen eye on inflation reports and how they align with monetary policies enacted by the Federal Reserve. \n",
      "\n",
      "## Impact on the Stock Market\n",
      "\n",
      "The relationship between inflation and the stock market is intricate. Typically, rising inflation leads to higher interest rates, which can dampen stock market performance as borrowing costs increase for companies and consumers alike. However, certain sectors may benefit from inflation caused by increased demand or production costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Potential Market Reactions**:\n",
      "    - **Interest-Rate Sensitive Stocks**: Sectors such as utilities and real estate may experience volatility as interest rates fluctuate.\n",
      "    - **Consumer Discretionary**: Increased disposable income can lead to growth in sectors like retail and automobiles, even amid rising prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Investors should consider diversifying their portfolios to include assets that historically perform well during inflationary periods, such as commodities and real estate investment trusts (REITs). \n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations for Investors\n",
      "\n",
      "With inflation expected to stabilize, investors should adapt their strategies while remaining vigilant. Here are some action points for those looking to navigate the stock market in 2024:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Review and Rebalance Portfolios**: Assess current holdings and consider trimming positions in interest-sensitive sectors while exploring growth opportunities in inflation-resistant areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Keep Informed**: Regularly monitor economic indicators, including inflation reports and interest rate decisions from the Federal Reserve, to make informed investment choices.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Consider Inflation-Linked Investments**: Instruments such as Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) can provide a hedge against inflation, ensuring capital preservation during economic fluctuations.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Navigating inflation in the US is critical for making sound investment decisions as we head into 2024. By understanding the economic dynamics at play and how they affect the stock market, investors can position themselves for success. Remember to stay educated and flexible; the market conditions may shift rapidly.\n",
